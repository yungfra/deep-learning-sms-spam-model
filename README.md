I built a Deep Learning Model in order to detect Spam SMS. You can see creation, training and evaluation of the model in the Notebook file. I also created an app in Gradio that uses this model in order to test it. Everything is in the .ipynb file. You can convert the .h5 file for various usages, enjoy!
